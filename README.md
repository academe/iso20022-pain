# Pain.001

**This repository has moved to https://github.com/consilience/iso20022-pain**

**Pain.001** is a PHP library to generate UK pain.001.001.06 XML messages (complies with ISO-20022).

## Installation
Consilience\Pain001
Just install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) and run `composer require consilience/iso20022-pain` in your project directory.

## TODO

This library is based on the Swiss PAIN library.
I am adapting it for UK usage.
It will support pain.001.001.06 version.
Future versions or multiple versions will need a rethink on how this package is structured.

Until the updates are complete, take all these instructions with a pinch of salt;
they will probably be wrong.

Main changes:

* New root namespace.
* UK bank financial institution type.
* Switch to `moneyphp\money` package rather than home-grown.
* Support for supplementary info records.
* Switch to version `06` of the pain.001 format.
* UK-oriented XML namespaces.

## Usage

To get a basic understanding on how the messages are structured, take a look [the resources](#further-resources) mentioned below. The following example shows how to create a message containing two transactions:

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Consilience\Pain001\FinancialInstitution\BIC;
use Consilience\Pain001\Account\IBAN;
use Consilience\Pain001\Message\CustomerCreditTransfer;
use Money\Money;
use Consilience\Pain001\PaymentInformation\PaymentInformation;
use Consilience\Pain001\Account\PostalAccount;
use Consilience\Pain001\Address\StructuredPostalAddress;
use Consilience\Pain001\TransactionInformation\BankCreditTransfer;
use Consilience\Pain001\TransactionInformation\IS1CreditTransfer;
use Consilience\Pain001\Address\UnstructuredPostalAddress;

$transaction1 = new BankCreditTransfer(
    'instr-001',
    'e2e-001',
    Money::CHF(130000), // CHF 1300.00
    'Muster Transport AG',
    new StructuredPostalAddress('Wiesenweg', '14b', '8058', 'ZÃ¼rich-Flughafen'),
    new IBAN('CH51 0022 5225 9529 1301 C'),
    new BIC('UBSWCHZH80A')
);

$transaction2 = new IS1CreditTransfer(
    'instr-002',
    'e2e-002',
    Money::CHF(30000), // CHF 300.00
    'Finanzverwaltung Stadt Musterhausen',
    UnstructuredPostalAddress::sanitize('Altstadt 1a', '4998 Musterhausen'),
    new PostalAccount('80-151-4')
);

$payment = new PaymentInformation(
    'payment-001',
    'InnoMuster AG',
    new BIC('ZKBKCHZZ80A'),
    new IBAN('CH6600700110000204481')
);
$payment->addTransaction($transaction1);
$payment->addTransaction($transaction2);

$message = new CustomerCreditTransfer('message-001', 'InnoMuster AG');
$message->addPayment($payment);

echo $message->asXml();
```

**Tip:** Take a look at `Consilience\Pain001\Tests\Message\CustomerCreditTransferTest` to see all payment types in action.

## Caveats

- Not all business rules and recommendations are enforced, consult the documentation and **validate the resulting transaction file in cooperation with your bank**.
- At the moment cheque transfers are not supported (for details consult chapter 2.2 of the Implementation Guidelines)
- The whole project is still under development and therefore BC breaks can occur. Please contact me if you need a stable code base.
